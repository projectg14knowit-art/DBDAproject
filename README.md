## Project Title -: Credit Risk Analysis for Loan Applicants

Project Description –:

This project aims to identify patterns that indicate a client may struggle to repay their loan installments. The findings could be used by the bank to take preventive actions such as rejecting loans, reducing loan amounts, or charging higher interest rates for riskier applicants. The goal is to ensure that borrowers who are capable of repaying their loans are not unfairly rejected, while minimizing the risk of default.

Using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning (ML) algorithms, the company will identify key variables, or "driver variables," that are strong predictors of loan default. The project will leverage Python programming and popular Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib to process and visualize data, as well as implement machine learning models. Additionally, Tableau will be used to create interactive and insightful dashboards for visualizing the data and model results. Through these techniques, the bank will be able to better understand the factors influencing loan defaults and improve its portfolio management and risk assessment strategies, ultimately making more informed and accurate lending decisions
